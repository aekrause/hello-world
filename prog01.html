<h1>Raising Children Costs</h1>
<p>Being financially stable is key before starting a family. This blog will give the statistics on what the average cost in america it is to have a child.

Per child in the united states it was found that it cost $233,610 to raise a single child. This price includes all expenses from birth to the age of 17. </p>

<h1>Younger Years</h1>
<p>In the first year of life alone it costs around $12000. Costs of baby food, clothes, formula alone are $50 a week. 

Any medical complication can raise the price significantly. You will need good insurance to cover doctor visits for the baby, as well as the mother. Before insurance, the cost of a natural birth is 9 thousand, and a cesarean is 12 thousand.</p>

<h1>After 17</h1>
<p>Since the original cost of 233,610 only covers the first 17 years, this assumes the child becomes financially independent and moves out of the house at this age. But for most people, this is not the case. Nowadays people are having to go to college to get a degree so that they are able to support them self in the future. And  the parents most likely will help them pay for this to some extent.  The price of colleges can go anywhere from 50 to 100 thousand for four years.</p>
