<p> After using the three platforms of making a website,  my personal favorite is using the mdrive. I like this method because it is
  easy to use notepad++ to save a html file and open it from anywhere. However the 000Website host could be better for checking for errors and
  being more leneant for accepting code. Where as the notepad++ might not be able to tell you the errors that are in your code. But with the
  simple website use of giving information and facts and pictures, Notepad++ was the easiest to use.</p>
